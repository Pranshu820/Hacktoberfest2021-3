// What? You don't know what a beautiful year is! Let me tell you!
// A beautiful year is the year in which all digits of that year are different from each other, examples are 2013 or 1987!

// This program takes an integer t as an input, which is the total number of test cases.
// Refer to this https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002470854-Test-cases if you don't know about test cases!
// The next input is a year and the program will output the just next beautiful year.
// Give it a try!
